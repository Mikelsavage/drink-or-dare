    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <p>This epic game will make your party go from good to slightly above average. We recommend playing with at least 3
        people, but the more the merrier. Players must be thirsty before playing.</p>

    <h2>Before Starting</h2>

    <p>Decide as a group what a "drink" is considered. We recommend drinking water to stay hidrated, but this game may be played
        with whatever drink your heart desires. If drinking alcohol (assuming all players are at least 21 years of age),
        a "drink" could be as little as a sip of beer or as flamboyant as a shot.</p>

    <h2>Starting</h2>

    <p>The alpha of your group should create the game, so make sure you know where you stand in your friend group. From
        the <a href="#">starting page</a>, the individual will enter a game name, hit the start button, and that's it!</p>

    <h2>Playing</h2>

    <p>All players have the ability to create new dares. When new dares are added to the game, the game begins. For each
        player's turn, they will be given a random dare. The player has a choice to either do the dare, or take a drink.
        If a player receives a dare that they created, and he/she does not perform the dare, the individual must take 2
        drinks. Basically, don't have someone do something that you wouldn't do yourself.</p>
